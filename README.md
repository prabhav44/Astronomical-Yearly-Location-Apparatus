Jupiter moons project

Think of this as an open sourced water tower, what spigot you choose to make is up to you

The backend.py file is like an astronomy simulation multi-tool, modify it for any two planetary bodies (e.g. orbit of pluto around sun) and it will generate a 3D plot on a cartesian coordinate system when used in a way similar to the db_gen.py file (graph not provided, use any graphing software you would like)

Currently Josh_GUI is using this water tower to design a modernized version of the project CLEA lab where students would calculate the mass of jupiter using a Jovian Satellite simulator
