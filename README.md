Jupiter moons project

Think of this as a very high level API wrapper for the presentation of data on the JPL Horizons website

The backend.py file is like an astronomy simulation multi-tool, use it for any two planetary bodies (e.g. orbit of pluto around sun) and it will generate data for use on a cartesian coordinate system (ex: db_gen.py file)

Currently Josh_GUI is using this wrapper to design a modernized version of the project CLEA lab where students would calculate the mass of jupiter using a Jovian Satellite simulator
