# Astronomical-Yearly-Location-Apparatus
Jupiter moons project

Think of this as an open sourced water tower, what spigot you choose to make is up to you

The backend.py file is like an astronomy simulation multi-tool, modify it for any two planetary bodies (e.g. orbit of pluto around sun) and it will generate a 3D plot on a cartesian coordinate system (graph not provided, use any graphing software you would like)

Currently Josh_GUI is using this water tower to design a modernized version of the project CLEA lab where students would calculate the mass of jupiter using a Jovian Satellite simulator


# Note from Prabhav Parashar(Lead):

I set out with something to prove. That's all this started as, it was my team (Josh Braxton and Brad Reamy) and Professor Wood that led me to realize it was about something much bigger than myself and personal gain. Sure scholarships are nice but how often can people say they have made a difference on the most important industry in the world, education.

I hope that by open sourcing this I am able to inspire students of all kinds, whether it be those who believe that something could have been done better or those who are simply interested in the subject matter. Whatever your background may be in whatever field it is the initial thought and action that separates those who make an impact versus those who do not. 

I encourage the experienced programmer, the inexperienced scripter, the hobbyist, and above all those who simply think they can, to make an impact. I will actively maintain this repository and sub-projects for the foreseeable future in an effort to not only inspire those at FCC but to inspire learners of all kinds.

I would like to thank my team for sticking with me through the thick of it. I would like to thank Dr. Wood for giving me an opportunity when all seemed lost.

Thank you for your time,
Prabhav Parashar
